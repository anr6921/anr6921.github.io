# 230_Final

For my final project, I intend to create two interactive images and one simple game. The first will consist of small dots which form an image, and when the user hovers over the image the dots change in some way. The second will be a switch that can be turned on and off to change the background color of the site. Lastly, the game will be a dot controlled by the mouse cursor and the player must dodge incoming circles.

In order to complete my idea, I will use resources such as W3 Schools and the SVG animation and interaction tutorials.
