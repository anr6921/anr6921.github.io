CHANGES

My project is quite different than what I initially planned on doing. I started off using Node.js with the intention to make a multiplayer game hosted on a server. I was able to get multiple players on the canvas through the server, however, I quickly realised I did not have the time I needed to turn this into a full game. I almost completely started over to create DON'T EAT THE YELLOW SNOW.


***REQUIREMENTS***

1) MEDIA
	SOUND
	-background music loops
	-sound effect when eating yellow snow
	-all sounds are MP3s
	-I used royalty free sounds I found online (:
	IMAGES
	-I created all the art assets myself. 
	-All images are PNG format
	TEXT
	-Theme appropriate, easy to read
	CANVAS
	-everything is drawn on the canvas
	-Mulitple images are drawn onto the canvas
	-I used spritesheets for player character
	-Smoothed using requestAnimationFrame and delta time
	-Graphics are heck'n sick


2) INTERACTION
	-Control using WASD and arrow keys to move Dewey
	-Switch to dark mode using the drop down
		
3) USABILITY
	- custom pause screen 
	- instructions page
	- score and health visible
	- easy to play
	- switch states by clicking 
	- Four states: Title, instructions, main game, game over

4) EXPERIENCE
	- Though it's very different from my original plan, the game still has same movement mechanics as well as concept.

5) CODING
	- I did not use any libraries
	- Loads in images
	- Uses object literals
	- Uses module pattern
	- New function constructors including snow, yellow snow, and player.
	- uses strict
	- new operator is followed by capitalized constructor
	- lowercase for everything else
	- uses semicolons;
	- uses var for variable declaration
	- commented appropriately

ABOVE AND BEYOND!
I did all of the art myself, which probably took as much time as coding the project itself. This was my first time doing pixel art, so I had fun teaching myself.

WHAT WENT RIGHT
The final product looks great, and the idea behind it is humorous. I was able to scope down my project in order to achieve this more complete product. Also, I created all of the assets so this game is visually unique.

WHAT WENT WRONG
Because I completely started over, there was less time to finish than I would've liked. If I had more time, I would add better player animation as well as some animation for when Dewey eats the yellow snow.
